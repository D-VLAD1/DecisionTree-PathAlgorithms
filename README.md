# DecisionTree-PathAlgorithms

That project is composed of the Bellman-Ford algorithm and the Decision Tree Classifier.

## The Bellman-Ford Algorithm

The algorithm was created in order to find the shortest path from start
point (you should specify which one) to all other points in directed graph.
The graph should have weighted edges.

Time complexity of the algorithm that implemented here -> `O(n^2)`.

Implemented by `Vladyslav Danylyshyn`.

## The Decision Tree Classifier

The algorithm is used widely in Machine Learning. The concept of the tree
we've learned within the Discrete Math course. We create a tree that has some conditions
(or thresholds) as the node value. The decision is set inside leafs of the tree. Simply
pass the input data, it goes through the nodes, and then get the decision!
