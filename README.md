# DecisionTree-PathAlgorithms

That project is composed of the Bellman-Ford algorithm.

## The Bellman-Ford Algorithm

The algorithm was created in order to find the shortest path from start
point (you should specify which one) to all other points in directed graph.
The graph should have weighted edges.

Time complexity of the algorithm that implemented here -> `O(n^2)`.

Implemented by `Vladyslav Danylyshyn`.
